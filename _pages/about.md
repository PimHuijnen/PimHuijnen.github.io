I am a digital cultural historian at Utrecht University. My work centres on
understanding how digital sources and methods can help us analyse cultural
phenomena in the past. On this site I share updates about ongoing research
projects, links to teaching materials, and notes on public history outreach.

When I'm not working with historical datasets you can find me lecturing on
digital humanities or blogging about new tools. Feel free to reach out via the
links below if you'd like to collaborate.
