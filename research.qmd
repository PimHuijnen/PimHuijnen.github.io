###   Digital history {#digital-history}

My research focuses on digital text analysis to study conceptual change over time. I am particularly interested in the circulation of knowledge across different domains—such as science, politics, industry, and popular culture. How can traces of eugenic thinking be found in Dutch public discourse, for example, even though eugenics was condemned by large parts of society? Or how did Dutch companies and organizations interpret the American notion of "efficiency" after World War I, and how did the philosophy of efficiency come to shape ever more domains of life? How has the food industry defined concepts like "healthy food"—or, for that matter, "sustainable food"—in changing ways over time?

I like developing and using computational methods to study questions like these, because they enable me to map conceptual changes in textual data that covers large spans of time and/or that allows me to compare different domains of life or different countries.

My latest projects were, first, the [Semantics of Sustainability](https://semantics-of-sustainability.github.io/Website/index.html){.external target="_blank"} (2022-2025, funded by the [Nl eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/){.external target="_blank"}, which leverages LLMs to study the Dutch public discourse around "sustainability" (together with [Parisa Zahedi](https://github.com/parisa-zahedi){.external target="_blank"}, [Carsten Schnober](https://carschno.github.io/){.external target="_blank"}, [José Angel Daza](https://github.com/angel-daza){.external target="_blank"}, [Mees van Stiphout](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MvanStiphout){.external target="_blank"} and [Pablo Merayo Montes](https://github.com/Pablo-Merayo){.external target="_blank"}. Second, I have set up a machine learning pipeline to do a sentiment analysis of the discourse around fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewable energy in Dutch newspapers between 1950 and 1995 (funded by the UU Research IT Innovation Fund 2022 and the UU Applied Data Science Seed Fund 2024, together with [Jaap Verheul](https://www.uu.nl/staff/JVerheul){.external target="_blank"}, [Gertjan Plets](https://www.uu.nl/staff/GFJPlets){.external target="_blank"}, [Anastasia Giachanou](http://giachanou.com/){.external target="_blank"}, [Leonardo Vida](https://www.leonardovida.com/){.external target="_blank"}, [Parisa Zahedi](https://github.com/parisa-zahedi){.external target="_blank"} and [Shiva Nadi Najafabadi](https://www.uu.nl/staff/SNadiNajafabadi){.external target="_blank"}. Our code can be found on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/historical-news-sentiment){.external target="_blank"}.

In 2024/25 I was the editor of a special issue on the state of the field of digital history in the Netherlands and Belgium for the journal BMGN-Low Countries Historical Review. The issue aims to show how (young) digital historians employ computational techniques to contribute to the current historiographical literature. The contributions demonstrate the wide diversity of the field of digital history in terms of techniques and data (audio, visual, textual) used, as well as the background of the authors. The contributions are published in a for this journal new (html-based) format, allowing interactive visualisations as well as added 'layers' with background information on data and methodology. My reflections on the special issue, in which I also address the rationale behind this format, can be found [here](https://bmgn-lchr.nl/article/view/21151){.external target="_blank"} (open access).

I regularly advise cultural heritage institutions on matters concerning digitisation and digital use of cultural data.

### Reproducibility

Together with my colleague [Pieter Huistra](https://www.uu.nl/staff/PAHuistra){.external target="_blank"} I'm studying the opportunities and limits of reproducibility for historical scholarship. Together we have written a [White Paper](https://zenodo.org/records/7037401){.external target="_blank"} that explains our perspective on the matter, based on an experiment in reproductions that we ran together with a group of students. The project and paper have received a great deal of interest. We have given multiple papers and keynotes, taught courses and we are still further developing our perspective in new publications.

### History of concepts and history of science

I have a special interest in the theory of conceptual history, especially that of Reinhart Koselleck. I enjoy finding ways to put his theories around time experience to the test. I have published about this in Contributions to the History of Concepts (‘Something Happened to the Future. Reconstructing Temporalities in Dutch Parliamentary Debate, 1814-2018’ [](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/downloadpdf/view/journals/contributions/16/2/choc160204.pdf){.external target="_blank"}) and in Digital Scholarship in the Humanities ('Everyday memory: A computational analysis of changing relations between past and present in Dutch newspapers in the twentieth Century' [](https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/40/Supplement_1/i27/7614566){.external target="_blank"}). 

I was trained as historian of science, having writing my master thesis about the Austrian theoretical physicist Paul Ehrenfest and my PhD thesis about the discovery of vitamins and the advent of nutrition science in the Netherlands in the first half of the twentieth century. The latter has left me with an enduring interest in food history.
